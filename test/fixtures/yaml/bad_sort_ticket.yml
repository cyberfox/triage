        <div><p>If I try to sort lines with Current or Price column, result is
        unknown sort order. (check the picture)</p>
        <p>I would understand IF those different currencies would be sorted
        as "subgroups" (and inside that subgroup those lines would be
        sorted) but now there is no logic how system sorts. Of course BEST
        solution would be that, that user could put "home currency f.ex.
        &#8364;" and then tell system that US$=&#8364; 1.4=1,
        &pound;=&#8364; 1.04=1 and so on... MOST greatest feature would be
        that system automatically checks some exchange site like <a href="http://www.xe.com">http://www.xe.com</a> drag out XML information
        of exchange values between different currencies.</p>
